            The Mercedes-Benz brand was born under a lucky star: the current
            trademark comprising a three-pointed star in a laurel wreath was
            created in 1925 in time for the merger between
            Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) and Benz & Cie., which together
            became Daimler-Benz AG, in summer 1926.
